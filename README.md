## About W2QTI
Increase your workflow by importing your questions from your Word document to TAO.

The most frequent interaction used in digital assessment is Choice. Many QTI users asked me to find a way to quickly import their long word documents filled with choice questions. Here is a solution.

W2QTI is a web application that converts your multi-choice or single-choice questions from word to the QTI format. What is the QTI format ? It is an XML standard defined by <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.imsglobal.org/question/qtiv2p2/imsqti_v2p2_impl.html">IMS Global</a> that is compatible with many assessment platforms like <a target="_blank" href="www.taotesting.com">TAO</a> for example.

You can easely import to your assessment platform not only your items' content but also their correction and soon many other options and CSS choices.

The idea is to respect a very simple structure in a Word document. Modify your document and then paste your work in the text area. Please stay under 150 questions in a row. You can download <a href="https://www.wiquid.fr/projects/w2qti/cmod.docx" target="_blank" >here a Word.docx modele</a> to help you.

This converter does not save any data about your item on the server. No cookies and no information are stored.
